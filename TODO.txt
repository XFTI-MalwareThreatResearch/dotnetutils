TODO:
- remove all raise Exception()
- Change method names to use '::' notation instead of periods when splitting the class and method name.
- Rework how instruction arguments are handled a bit.
- Before to_bytes(), add something that cleans off any extra strings or other items from the heaps in order to keep binary size down.
- double check that cctors arent being called twice.
- Function graphing and control flow cleaning.
- Fix various warnings related to sphinx docs.
- Update has_return_value() to work with CmodOpt sigs (can still be void)

Control Flow Deobfuscation:
- Still very much in beta
- for babel sample 7005baba5671e99eb677bc7dff5b2e15527cb196668ad0340e9f015903430625 method 0x0600008C:
    - loop constants are protected by a method.  Babel deobfuscator would likely have to remove this separately
    - Additional changes are needed beyond that to support the scheme that method's control flow obfuscation uses.
- after control flow deobfuscation is complete, update relevant xrefs.
